Have you ever went away on holidays and decided to take a tour of the city to see all the highlights that the town provides. If you, you must be familiar to the speed at which the tour goes; slowly detailing all landmarks on the track. Through rain and sun, in a cluster of people and umbrellas.

It is 2019, so it is time for a change. CityGuide aims to detach all the boredom of sightseeing allowing you to get through the landmarks at your pace, create your own course through the sights and choose the ones you want to visit. The guide is transformed into a device, that you just put in your pocket or strap to your belt.
